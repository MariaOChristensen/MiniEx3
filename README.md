The idea behind my throbber design is for the user to have something to look at while waiting. It is not so much an attempt to entertain as it is an attempt to mesmerize the user. I wish to give their mind a break in which they forget to be impatient and just exist in this moment without thinking - like when you find yourself hypnotized by a candle flame.
I chose the halo of the sun sigil from the Silent Hill series because I am a big fan and so that I did not have to start from scratch, but also because I hoped that it would have enough symbols and size to engulf the user who looked at it. And if thought into context - as a throbber used for the actual SH games - it could function as a space within to catch one's breath before yet again entering a state of mild anxiety in a survival horror universe.

The digital culture as I see it is very impatient - this notion is the fundament of my throbber design. With programming  we could challenge this impatience by - purely as an artistic design - inserting unnecessary breaks in a process. It is in the digital era that this impatience rose for real because programmers strived for their programs to run as fast and smoothly as possible, though this impatience may have that consequence that we less and less stop to enjoy the pace of things; most songs last less than 3 minutes, people rush through art galleries, we get more quickly angry in traffic when things do not run smoothly. Could it be possible to gradually set this impatience in reverse?
